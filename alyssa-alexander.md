# Alyssa Alexander
### Welcome to my Blog

My name is Alyssa Alexander, and here's some information about me:

I'm a Business major with a minor in Technology Management and French. I have moved around a lot growing up and I graduated from high school overseas.
I will be graduating in May and joining the workforce and hopefully getting money to travel! I am involved with various organizations on campus, two of which are Maggies and Camp Kesem. I am also a research assistant for Dr. Mendoza. I come from a LOOONG line of Aggies; I have two siblings who also attended Texas A&M. My brother graduated in 2018, and my sister in 2019.
I will miss being in college, especially the social aspect. I will miss going to football games and tailgating with my friends and family, though due to COVID-19, I already miss these things.

Thank you for reading!
