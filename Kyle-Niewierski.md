# Kyle Niewierski

### Get to know me!

Howdy! My name is Kyle Niewierski, and here's a little bit about me:

I'm a Technology Management major from San Antonio, Texas and will be graduating and commissioning into the US Air Force in May!
I work as a Student Technician at Texas A&M Transportation INStitute.
I have one younger brother, who is also in the Air Force.
I used to be a member of the Corps of Cadets and Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, but now I'm a 5th year and get to finally live off campus.
