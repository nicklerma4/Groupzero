### A Little bit about me

Howdy! My name is Cayden Steffey, here is some information about me:

I grew up in a very small town called Silver Valley, Texas. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Technology Management with a minor in Business. I enjoy being outside playing sports, hunting, and riding four-wheelers. My favorite sports are basketball and football. The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Chargers are my favorite NBA and NFL teams. Also, I am a very passionate Texas A&M fan (of course). I attend every home football game we have at Kyle Field, and most of the basketball games in Reed.
