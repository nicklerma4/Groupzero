Howdy! My name Ebenezer Zabayor, Here's some information about myself!

I'm a senior Technology Management major with a minor in Business and Cybersecurity from Dallas,TX. I was originally born in Lagos, Nigeria. 
After living there for 8 years I came to the states. I enjoy playing soccer, football and hanging with friends. 
I love Technology Management because it gives you the opportunity to learn more about the internet of things and how information management is essential in today's society.

Thanks for reading!
