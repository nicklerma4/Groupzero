# Ayodeji Okunnu
### Get to know me!


Howdy Everyone! My name is Ayodeji Okunnu and here is a little about me!

I'm a senior Technology Management major with a minor in Business from Alief,TX. A fun fact I was originally born in Long Beach,CA but I only ended up living there for two weeks.
During my final year here at A&M I am serving on the NPHC (National Panhellenic Council) as well as the President of my chapter for Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. My time here at A&M has been a rollercoaster ride and I am hoping to end the 20-21 school year with a bang!
