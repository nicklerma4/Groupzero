### Get to know me!


Howdy Everyone! My name is Ayodeji Okunnu and here is a little about me!

I'm a senior Technology Management major with a minor in Business from Alief,Tx. A fun fact I was originally born in Long Beach,CA but I only ended up living there for two weeks. 
During my final year here at A&M I am serving on the NPHC (National Panhellenic Council) as well as the President of my chapter for Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. My time here at A&M has been a rollercoaster ride and I am hoping to end the 20-21 school year with a bang!
I switched over into Technology Management the end of my sophmore year and I have loved it ever since. The major not only gives us the opportunity to learn about the IT world but also actively engages us in real world projects that beneftit us as students in the long run.
