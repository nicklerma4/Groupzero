# Nick Lerma
### Get to know me!

Howdy, my name is Nicholas Lerma and I would like to tell you a little about me.

I am from San Antonio, Texas and I am a Technology Management major and will be graduating in the spring!
My favorite basketball team is the San Antonio Spurs and I love fishing in my spare time.
I have two siblings, one twin brother and a little sister. 
The things I will miss most after graduating will be going to the football games at Kyle Field and tailgating with all my family and friends!

Thanks for getting to know me!
