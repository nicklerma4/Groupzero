### This is me!!

My name is Alec Azar, and here's some information about me:

I am a super-senior Technology Management major with a minor in cybersecurity and Business. I am from San Antonio, TX and grew up with three sisters. I enjoy playing indoor VOLLIEBALL or beach volleyball. I love music and movies and try and binge a new show every week. I love going to Texas A&M and could not see myself anywhere else. I am excited to graduate and hopefully make money so that I can TRAVLE. I currently work at the student recreation center on campus. I have a cat named Loki and I hope to one day get a dog!


Thank you for reading!!
